<h2 style="font-family:courier;"><u><a name="subtopic3">3.What are the different types of stocks?</a></u></h2>
<p><b><font size="+1">There are two main kinds of stocks, common stock and preferred stock.</font></b></p>
<ol type="i">
    <li><u><b style="color:powderblue;"><font size="+2">Common stock</font></b></u> entitles owners to vote at
        shareholder meetings and receive dividends.
    </li>
    <br></br>
    <li><u><b style="color:powderblue;"><font size="+2">Preferred stock</font></u></b> is a class of stock that is
        granted certain rights that differ from common stock. Namely, preferred stock often possesses higher dividend
        payments, and a higher claim to assets in the event of liquidation.Usually these stockholder have no voting
        rights.
    </li>
</ol>
<p><b><font size="+1">Common and preferred stocks may fall into one or more of the following categories:</font></b></p>
<ul>
    <li><u><b style="color:powderblue;"><font size="+2">Growth stocks</font></u></b> is any <b>share in a company that
        is anticipated to grow</b> at a rate significantly above the average growth for the market. These stocks <b>generally
        do not pay dividends</b>. A <b>start-up technology company</b> is likely to be a growth stock.
    </li>
    <br></br>
    <li><u><b style="color:powderblue;"><font size="+2">Income stocks</font></u></b> are stocks that <b>offer regular
        and steady income</b>, usually in the form of dividends, over a period of time <b>with low exposure to risk</b>.
        An <b>established utility company</b> is likely to be an income stock.
    </li>
    <br></br>
    <li><u><b style="color:powderblue;"><font size="+2">Value stocks</font></u></b> refers to shares of a <b>company
        that appears to trade at a lower price</b> relative to its fundamentals, such as dividends, earnings, or sales,
        making it appealing to value investors. People buy value stocks in the hope that the market has overreacted and
        that the stock’s price will rebound.
    </li>
    <br></br>
    <li><u><b style="color:powderblue;"><font size="+2">Blue-chip stocks</font></u></b> are shares of <b>very large and
        well-recognised companies</b> with a long history of sound financial performance. These stocks are known to have

<h2><u><a name="subtopic5">5.Where to buy or sell stocks?</a></u></h2>
<p><b><font size="+1">Buying or selling stocks can be done through:</font></b></p>
<ul>
    <li><u><b style="color:powderblue;"><font size="+2">Direct stock plans</font></u></b>, Some companies allow you to
        buy or sell their stock directly through them without using a broker. This saves on commissions, but you may
        have to pay other fees to the plan, including if you transfer shares to a broker to sell them.
        <br>
        <br>
    <li><u><b style="color:powderblue;"><font size="+2">Dividend reinvestment plans</u></b></font>, These plans allow
        you to buy more shares of a stock you already own by reinvesting dividend payments into the company. You must
        sign an agreement with the company to have this done.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li><u><b style="color:powderblue;"><font size="+2">Discount or full-service broker</u></b></font>, Brokers buy and
        sell shares for customers for a fee, known as a commission.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li><u><b style="color:powderblue;"><font size="+2">Stock funds</u></b></font> are another way to buy stocks. These
        are a type of mutual fund that invests primarily in stocks. Depending on its investment objective and policies,
        a stock fund may concentrate on a particular type of stock, such as blue chips, large-cap value stocks, or
        mid-cap growth stocks.

</ul>
<h2><u><a name="subtopic6">6.Stock Market</a></u></h2>
<p>The term stock market refers to several exchanges in which shares of publicly held companies are bought and sold.
    Such financial activities are conducted through formal exchanges and via over-the-counter (OTC) marketplaces that
    operate under a defined set of regulations.

    Both “stock market” and “stock exchange” are often used interchangeably.</p>
<p>Stock markets provide a secure and regulated environment where market participants can transact in shares and other
    eligible financial instruments with confidence, with zero to low operational risk. Operating under the defined rules
    as stated by the regulator, the stock markets act as primary markets and secondary markets</p>
